## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned some new CSS Psuedo element selectors such as ::marker.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<header class="title-description">
  <h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
  <p>
    An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines
    beaten eggs cooked to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of
    cheese, vegetables, or meats.
  </p>
</header>
```

```css
.instructions li::marker {
  color: #854632;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on learning more about CSS Grid and Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [CSS MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This helped me for setting the ordered list numbers color.
